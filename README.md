## Week 1
> ### Ranking of leaders and influencers in Africa

>Let’s imagine that you are doing this work for a large multinational company (let’s use Nike) that is planning a new digital campaign in Africa, and wants to understand who the social media influencers are in Africa and in which area fall into (e.g. politics, fashion, art, etc.). This is key to Nike as they don’t want to be associated with the wrong influencers (ethnic and religious polarisation figures for example).  This work is commissioned by a combination of their strategy and their marketing departments.
> Following Nike’s plan to start a new digital campaign in Africa, the understanding of Africa’s social media influencers is paramount to the success of this project. The social media platform chosen for the necessary analysis to be carried out was Twitter.

## Week 2
> ### User Analytics in the Telecommunication Industry

> You are working for a wealthy investor that specializes in purchasing assets that are undervalued.  This investor’s due diligence on all purchases includes a rich analysis of the data that underlies the business, to try to understand the fundamentals of the business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the focus of which products or services are being offered
>The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia.  TellCo’s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems.
>Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  You will do this by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network.

## Week 3
> ### Change point analysis to quantify the impact of African government policy interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 (Kenya)

> With COVID 19 running rampant in the world at the moment, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. The major challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when the first interventions show an effect. Focusing on Kenya, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlates well with the times of publicly announced interventions. We can, therefore, quantify the statistical significance of public health policies introduced by the Kenyan government to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

## Week 4
> ### A/B Hypothesis Testing: Ad campaign performance

> An advertising company is running an online ad for a client with the intention of increasing brand awareness. The advertiser company earns money by charging the client based on user engagements with the ad it designed and serves via different platforms. To increase its market competitiveness, the advertising company provides a further service that quantifies the increase in brand awareness as a result of the ads it shows to online users. The main objective of this project is to test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.
